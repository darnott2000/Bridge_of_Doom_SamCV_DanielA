# Bridge_of_Doom_SamCV_DanielA
 Class Project for Quantatative Engineering Analysis, Involving MATLAB, ROS, and Multivariate Calculus

Link to functioning open-loop Neato (Raspberry pi open-source Robot) bridge Crossing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22z4M8qeZ9s&feature=emb_logo

Runner.m calls the three other functions decleared as seperate .m files (betasweep, collectdataset, and startcode), sweeping through multiple speed multipliers (Beta) in attempts to cross the bridge. The other two MATLAB files are what we used to find theoretical values for the unit tangent and unit normal vectors as well as plotting this theoretical data over the experimental data from the NEATO once we had it.
